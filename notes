git log - prints the most recent few commits
git status - identifies if things have been staged “this is marked to be committed”, or (highlighted in red) are files changed but not committed - will also give commands to help reverse adding erroneous files - very important
git remote -v “make sure we have a mechanism to communicate with the remote repo”
git remote set-url __name of remote__ __new url__
git remote add __name of remote__ __url__
“upstream” is the final landing place, basically the hub for the entire class, whereas Origin is our teams personal hub for our project alone - both are remote however
git push -u __teams remote name__ __specific branch name__ (-u is only for when creating a new branch)
git branch - will give list of local branches with a star and green on the current checked out branch
When merge conflict - 
git checkout main
git pull or git pull __remote__ __branch__
git checkout __local__
git merge __remote__
|| be sure to remove annotations that git adds when merge conflict arise ||
merge from is above the line, merge to is below 
uncommitted changes will be lost if you go to checkout another branch in the middle of editing
